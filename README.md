# Social-Interaction-and-Crime

Gives R code and example output for the paper **Social Interaction and Crime**. Note that:
- for privacy reasons the underlying data is not allowed to be published; please contact me for further information if needed;
- this only give the code for the second stage estimations and subsequent analyses; first stage estimation is a straightforward (but time-consuming) logit analysis with alternative specific constants.
- one output file is given for the baseline case which should clarify the type of output and the working of the code

The files here are:
- `EstimationCrime.R`: basic the control file as it reads in data and give specifications for OLS, IV and quantile regressions. Note again that the underlying data cannot be made publicly available
